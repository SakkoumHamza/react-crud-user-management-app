# React CRUD Management App

This project is a simple CRUD app with basic functionality to create, read, update, and delete users. It demonstrates how to use React's core features, such as hooks and context API, to manage and manipulate data within the app.

## Features

- Add new users to the list
- View all users in a table
- Update user information
- Delete users
- Manage state using React Context API
- Use `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` hooks for state and side effects management

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building UI components
- **Context API**: For managing global state across the app
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages
- **Bootstrap**: For basic styling and layout

## Usage

1. **Add a User**  
   Click the "Add User" button to navigate to the user creation form.  
   Fill in the user details and click "Create" to add the user to the list.

   The home page displays a table of all users. If no users are present, a message indicating "No user found" will be displayed.

3. **Update a User**  
   In the user table, click the "Update" button next to a user to navigate to the update form.  
   Modify the user details and click "Update" to save the changes.
